## Degrees of Separation
> üìÅ Located in: `degrees/` directory

This project uses a **breadth-first search (BFS)** algorithm to determine the shortest path between two actors based on movies they've starred in together. The program loads a movie database and finds the minimal connection (degrees of separation) between any two people.

### How to run

```bash
python3 degrees.py small
```

or 

```bash
python3 degrees.py large
```

## Tic Tac Toe
> üìÅ Located in: `tictactoe/` directory  

This project implements an **AI agent** to play Tic Tac Toe using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning** to optimize decision-making. The algorithm simulates all possible game outcomes to choose the optimal move for each player and avoids unnecessary branches thanks to pruning.

### How to run

```bash
python3 runner.py
```
