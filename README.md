## 🧪 Testing & Code style

To test and validate the projects, I used the official CS50 tools:  
- `check50` to verify correctness  
- `style50` to check for code style and formatting

These tools are **optional** and included in the repository's `requirements.txt` file for convenience.  

To install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 My contributions

This repository follows the structure of this course. The codebase includes starter files provided by the instructors.

Below is a breakdown of my implementations:

- `search/degrees/`
  - Implemented `shortest_path()` in `degrees.py`.
- `search/tictactoe/`
  - Implemented all functions in `tictactoe.py`.
  - Developed helper functions: `max_value()` and `min_value()`.
